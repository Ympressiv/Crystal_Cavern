# Crystal_Cavern

A game designed to learn Blueprint programming. The assumptions of the game are very simple:
We are a ball of water that accelerates thanks to torque. The player controls the WASD keys and has to collect all the crystals and get to the finish line.
The player may fall off the map causing the level to restart or be shot down by the cannon. At this stage, the game provides two types of guns and the transition from level one to the second.

The game will finally be included in one joint project called Mars Marine.
Developed with Unreal Engine 4 and Blueprint.
